# Dont-Scan-QRs

QR Code Security Demonstration
Overview
This repository hosts a simple web demonstration aimed at educating users about the potential security risks of scanning unknown QR codes. The demo is designed for illustrative purposes and aims to emphasize the importance of digital caution.

Background
QR codes have become a prevalent method for quickly accessing digital information. However, as with all technologies, they come with potential risks. Scanning a malicious QR code could lead to unwanted consequences, such as exposing personal information or leading a user to harmful sites.

This demo simulates one such potential risk. Upon accessing the site via the QR code, users are greeted with a bold "Infected" message followed by a video. The intent is not to harm or deceive but to create a memorable experience that underscores the potential dangers.

Usage
Scanning the Code: Use any standard QR code scanner, like your phone's camera or a dedicated app.
Observing the Demo: Upon scanning, you'll be directed to a webpage. Observe the content.
Reflect: Think about how this innocent-looking QR code could have had malicious intent. Always exercise caution when scanning unknown codes.
